 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *    SysAPI [I] -- The main API to WhippyTerm
 *    Version [I] -- What version of WhippyTerm is running.  This is used
 *                   to make sure we are compatible.  This is in the

 *
 * FUNCTION:
 *    This function registers this plugin with the system.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 *    0 if we support this version of WhippyTerm, and the minimum version
 *    we need if we are not.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *    This function is normally is called from the RegisterPlugin() when
 *    it is being used as a normal plugin.  As a std plugin it is called
 *    from RegisterStdPlugins() instead.

 * FUNCTION:
 *    This function gets info about the plugin.  'DataProcessorInfo' has

 *          Tip -- A tool tip (for when you hover the mouse over this plugin)
 *          Help -- A help string for this plugin.
 *          ProType -- The type of process.  Supported values:
 *                  e_DataProcessorType_Text -- This is a text processor.
 *                      This is the more clasic type of processor (like VT100).
 *                  e_DataProcessorType_Binary -- This is a binary processor.
 *                      These are processors for binary protocol.  This may
 *                      be something as simple as a hex dump.
 *          TxtClass -- This only applies to 'e_DataProcessorType_Text' type
 *              processors. This is what class of text processor is
 *              this.  Supported classes:
 *                      e_TextDataProcessorClass_Other -- This is a generic class
 *                          more than one of these processors can be active
 *                          at a time but no other requirements exist.
 *                      e_TextDataProcessorClass_CharEncoding -- This is a
 *                          class that converts the raw stream into some kind
 *                          of char encoding.  For example unicode is converted
 *                          from a number of bytes to chars in the system.
 *                      e_TextDataProcessorClass_TermEmulation -- This is a
 *                          type of terminal emulator.  An example of a
 *                          terminal emulator is VT100.
 *                      e_TextDataProcessorClass_Highlighter -- This is a processor
 *                          that highlights strings as they come in the input
 *                          stream.  For example a processor that underlines
 *                          URL's.
 *                      e_TextDataProcessorClass_Logger -- This is a processor
 *                          that saves the input.  It may save to a file or
 *                          send out a debugging service.  And example is
 *                          a processor that saves all the raw bytes to a file.
